# PHP OOP: Additional Topics (Performance, PHP 8.0, Testing, Microservices)

## 1. Performance Optimization in PHP OOP

### Explore OOP Principles for Performance
Object-oriented programming (OOP) helps in building scalable and maintainable code, but it can also introduce performance overhead if not handled carefully. Here are ways to optimize OOP in PHP applications:

### Tips for OOP Performance Optimization:
- **Minimize Object Creation**: Creating too many objects can lead to high memory usage. Use singletons or static methods when applicable.
- **Avoid Deep Inheritance**: Deep inheritance hierarchies increase the complexity and overhead of method resolution. Favor composition over inheritance when possible.
- **Use Caching**: Use caching mechanisms (such as Redis or Memcached) to store frequently accessed data and avoid redundant object creation.
- **Lazy Loading**: Load objects or resources only when they are needed, rather than at the time of object instantiation.
- **Optimize Autoloading**: Make sure your autoloading mechanism (e.g., PSR-4) is efficient and loads only necessary classes.

## 2. PHP 8.0+ Features in OOP

### New Features in PHP 8.0 Related to OOP

1. **Union Types**:
   PHP 8.0 introduced union types, allowing a function parameter or return type to accept multiple types.
   
   ```php
   function add(int|float $a, int|float $b): int|float {
       return $a + $b;
   }
   ```

2. **Constructor Property Promotion**:
   PHP 8.0 introduced constructor property promotion, allowing you to define and initialize class properties directly in the constructor parameters.

   ```php
   class User {
       public function __construct(
           public string $name,
           public int $age
       ) {}
   }

   $user = new User('Alice', 30);
   ```

3. **Attributes**:
   Attributes allow metadata to be added to classes, properties, and methods, replacing PHPDoc comments for certain use cases.

   ```php
   #[Route("/users", methods: ["GET"])]
   class UserController {
       // ...
   }
   ```

These features make the code more concise, readable, and maintainable.

## 3. Mocking and Stubbing in Unit Testing

### Introduction to Mocking and Stubbing
**Mocking** and **stubbing** are techniques used in unit testing to simulate the behavior of dependencies. Mocking allows you to replace real dependencies with mock objects, while stubbing simulates method calls.

### Using Mockery for Mocking in PHPUnit:
**Mockery** is a popular library for creating mock objects in PHPUnit. It helps in isolating the class under test from its dependencies.

#### Example:
```php
use Mockery as m;
use PHPUnit\Framework\TestCase;

class UserServiceTest extends TestCase {
    public function testUserCreation() {
        $mockLogger = m::mock('Logger');
        $mockLogger->shouldReceive('log')->once()->with('User created');

        $userService = new UserService($mockLogger);
        $userService->createUser('Alice');

        $this->assertTrue(true);
    }

    protected function tearDown(): void {
        m::close();
    }
}
```

Mocking and stubbing ensure that you test only the behavior of the class in isolation, avoiding side effects from external dependencies.

## 4. Microservices and OOP in PHP

### Applying OOP Principles in Microservices Architecture
Microservices architecture involves breaking down an application into small, independent services that communicate via APIs. OOP principles can be applied in microservices to ensure modularity, reusability, and encapsulation.

### Key OOP Practices in Microservices:
- **Encapsulation**: Each microservice should manage its own state and expose only necessary functionalities through APIs.
- **Interfaces for Communication**: Use interfaces or contracts to define communication between microservices. Each service can have well-defined interfaces for interaction with other services.
- **Dependency Injection**: Each microservice can have its dependencies injected, making it easier to test and swap components.

#### Example:
```php
interface UserService {
    public function getUser($id);
}

class UserApiService implements UserService {
    public function getUser($id) {
        // Call to external user service
        return $this->httpClient->get("/users/{$id}");
    }
}

class OrderService {
    protected $userService;

    public function __construct(UserService $userService) {
        $this->userService = $userService;
    }

    public function createOrder($userId) {
        $user = $this->userService->getUser($userId);
        // Create order for user
    }
}
```

Microservices encourage loose coupling and high cohesion, which are fundamental OOP principles.

## Conclusion

The additional topics of **performance optimization**, **PHP 8.0 features**, **mocking and stubbing in unit testing**, and **microservices** provide powerful tools and techniques to make your OOP code more efficient, testable, and scalable. Leveraging these practices ensures that your PHP applications remain maintainable and performant as they grow.
